## How to Submit a Problem

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your problem to the `problems/` folder using this format:
   - `$category/$subcategory/problem-name/`
     - `README.md` – problem description
     - `input.txt` – sample input
     - `output.txt` – sample output
3. Make sure your problem folder is named clearly (e.g., `prime-sum`)
4. Submit a Pull Request with a short title like: `Add problem: Prime Sum`
* if you can, try not to make a new category/subcategory

## Guidelines

- No plagiarism!
- Make sure your problem has clear constraints
- Solutions should be feasible under time/memory limits (specify these)
